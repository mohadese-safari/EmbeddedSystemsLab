#  Pull-up resistors

It's useful for avoiding noises and preventing the pin being in unknown state .
As in first screenshot when the switch is off, pin is reciving low current cause of high resistance. so it's logical state is 1.
when it's onm with the earth connection the logical state of pin becomes 0.
